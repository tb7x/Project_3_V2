# Project_3_V2


//This project is to make a voting system for uses such as an NFT project that would like feedback from their community members. Members can vote on many things such as giveaways,
whether or not to start a DOW, etc. Building a voting application on a decentralized database (DApp) ensures that it is more secure and less likely to be manipulated by outside parties
aswell as making sure that each voter is authenticated and the community is able to propose ideas.
